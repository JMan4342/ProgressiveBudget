## Description

With the progressive budget app, the user will be able to track their budget whether they are connected to the internet or off-line.  By utilizing cache storage, the user can have the same user interaction with the budget app if they happen to be disconnected from the internet.  Any transactions done with the app while they are off-line will be saved, and once they reastablish a connection then all transactions will be updated to the tracker.
